Performace
----------------------
Overall, we were proud of our performance because Romi was able to navigate through the garage section of the course and make it to the wall section. Some issues that we did notice regarding our performance were that Romi's line following around the dotted line section was inconsistent, meaning that it worked most of the time but would occasionally lose the line, causing Romi to enter a death-circle pattern. Other than that, everything else regarding Romi's performance was consistent and ideal.
