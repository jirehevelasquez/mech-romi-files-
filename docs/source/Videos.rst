Performace
----------------------
Overall we were proud of our performace because Romi was able to navigate thought the garage section of the cource and make it to the wall section. Some issues that we did notice regarding our performace was that Romi's line following around the dotted line section was inconsistent meaning that it worked most of the time, but would occasionaly lose the line causing romi to enter a death circle pattern. Other than that everything else regarding Romi's performace was consistant and ideal.
